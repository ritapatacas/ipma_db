# IPMA Weather Data Fetcher

! WIP !


## Overview

This app is designed to automatically retrieve meteorological data from [IPMA](https://api.ipma.pt/) (Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere) stations and store it in MongoDB. The primary goal is to support agricultural decisions by analyzing key weather parameters like temperature, precipitation, and humidity. This data-driven approach aims to optimize the irrigation systems for red fruit cultivation, enhancing resource efficiency and sustainability :)

## Features

Data Collection: Fetches real-time weather data including temperature, precipitation, and humidity.
Database Integration: Seamlessly stores the fetched data in MongoDB for persistence and easy retrieval.
Resource Optimization: Analyzes the weather data to adjust irrigation schedules, minimizing water usage while maximizing crop yield.
