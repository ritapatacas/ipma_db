# IPMA Weather Data Fetcher

## üå§Ô∏è Overview

This app automatically retrieves weather data from [IPMA](https://api.ipma.pt/) stations and stores **Ansi√£o** station data in a MongoDB cluster.

The main goal is to **support agricultural decisions** in my red fruit exploration by analyzing key weather parameters like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and more.

By adopting this data-driven approach, I aim to **optimize irrigation systems**, improving resource efficiency and sustainability (hopefully, in the near bright future! üòâ).
